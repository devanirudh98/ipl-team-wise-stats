# IPL Team-wise Stats
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional cricket league in India contested by teams representing different cities in India.

I used 2 data sets for this project. The first was matches.csv which had match-by-match data for all IPL Matches from 2008 to 2019. The second was deliveries.csv which had ball-by-ball data for all IPL Matches from 2008 to 2019. I used Pandas and Numpy for the data analysis, Plotly for data visualization and Ipywidgets for making user interactive widgets. I also used Heroku to convert my Notebooks to a web app.
